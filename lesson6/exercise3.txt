# Modify an existing file
$ vi ip_addresses.yaml 

# Add a new file
$ vi routers.yaml

# One modified file and one untracked file.
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   ip_addresses.yaml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	routers.yaml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

# 'git add' both files.
$ git add ip_addresses.yaml

# The working directory is now clean
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean


####### Exercise 3b #######

# Undo the last commit, return the changes from the last commit to staging.
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

# The current state of the branch is the changes from the last commit are now
# in the 'staged' state.
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   ip_addresses.yaml
	new file:   routers.yaml

# Yes, the pending changes are there (in staged state)

# Yes, we could now undo the changes using 'git restore --staged <file>'


####### Exercise 3c #######

# Re-commit the pending changes
$ git commit -m "Adding routers.yaml; updating ip_addresses.yaml"
[main 80a4bae] Adding routers.yaml; updating ip_addresses.yaml
 2 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 lesson6/routers.yaml

# Verify the working directory is again clean.
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.

nothing to commit, working tree clean


####### Exercise 3d #######

$ git reset --mixed HEAD~1
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	lesson6/ip_addresses.yaml

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   ip_addresses.yaml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	routers.yaml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

# The '--mixed' reset undid the commit and unstaged the changes (so it
# reverted the working directory to the state it was in before the commit
# and before the 'git add' commands').

# So '--soft' undoes the commit, but keeps the changes in staging; '--mixed'
# undoes the commit and also reverts staging (to the state of the previous
# commit).


####### Exercise 3e #######

# Re-add and re-commit the changes
$ git add ip_addresses.yaml routers.yaml 
$ git commit -m "Adding routers.yaml; updating ip_addresses.yaml"

$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
HEAD is now at 1f62d32 Lesson6, ex3

# Note, the blob and tree objects from the removed commit are likely still in
# the Git object store (until they get garbage collected by Git)
